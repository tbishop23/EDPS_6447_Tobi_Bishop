It's not uncommon for an athlete to burn over 10,000 calories during the race, and on average an IRONMAN will lose 5.5 pounds during that time as well. That's about five times the recommended caloric intake for the average American! (www.active.com)"

		hint: "This may be common sense, but many people ask why the order of a triathlon goes [the way it does]. It's simple—it's ordered based on safety. The swim is first so athletes are in the water when they're fresh and not exhausted after two other legs. You can always stop to walk your bike or pause during the run, but unfortunately you can't really stop and take a breather during the swim. (www.active.com)",

Triathletes pee in their wetsuits during the swim, pee on their bike while in the saddle and pee while running. In a sport where every second counts, a bathroom stop might mean the difference between a spot on the podium and fourth place. (www.active.com)"
